# VSC-Info
Shows the Current VS Code version in the status bar.

## Why
I use VS Code on different systems with different VS Code versions. Not all systems have auto-update functionality. The information in the status bar helps immediately identify which version is running.

## Versioning
YY.MM.VERSION

- YY: Release year
- MM: Release month
- VERSION: Version in year/month
